# structbio_workflows

This is a repository of structural bioinformatics workflows, designed for tasks related to topics such as structure-based drug design, molecular dynamics simulation setup and analysis.

The workflows include Python scripts which can be run from the Linux terminal. 

Please note that although the workflows are tested prior to their deposition here, they are not meant to be used "as is". We only provide these for convenience to those who intend to perform similar tasks for their own projects. 

## List of workflows:

### dss.py

### dss_analysis.py

### md_traj_analysis.py

## How to run the workflows?

** Work in progress **
